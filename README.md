# Course Directory

Course Directory is a portal to various course sites at YCP. Due to copyright concerns, for students to contribute to this project they have to obtain teacher approval and send it via a Google form to me

## Getting Started

This entire project is raw HTML, CSS, and some JS. Simply cloning or downloading this repo should give you the the whole project as it is currently. 
You can access the site at [CourseDirectory.space](CourseDirectory.space). It's currently hosted by Namecheap and hosted by GitHub pages.

## Contributing

Check out [Contribute](http://coursedirectory.space/nav/about.html) on the site if you're interested in development, adding more courses, or helping out in any other way.
